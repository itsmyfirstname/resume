          Was assigned to the Global Data Retention team.
          Our main responsibility was custodial in nature, as we were tasked with the deletion of data from various source systems. 
          We ingested, classified, sorted, archived, and finally deleted data, following strict rules and protocols provided from our legal team, in compliance with global PII and PHI laws.

          We coordinated with teams in asia, europe, and north america to delete customer data, which posed an undue risk to the company.

          Quinnipiac was a sleepy New England university, which fancies itself as a `little ivy`; always raised an eyebrow for me, but i digress.
          My time at Quinnipiac taught me how to work with younger individuals with a greater skill set than myself, and helped me realize how much I enjoy identifying and prefecting patterns.
          Most of my time was spent with my economics professor running through sasticical models, and learning R in the process. Shortly after learning R, I switched my major to CIS, so I 
          could focus on the endless patterns that are associated with technology.
