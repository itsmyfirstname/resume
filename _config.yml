          My time at Quinnipiac taught me how to work with younger individuals with a greater skill set than myself, and helped me realize how much I enjoy identifying and perfecting patterns.
          Most of my time was spent with my economics professor running through statistic models, and learning R in the process. Shortly after learning R, I switched my major to CIS, so I 
          could focus on the endless patterns that are associated with technology.
